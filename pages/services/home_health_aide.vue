                              have significant difficulty leaving your home and
                              require assistance to do so. Your doctor will

                              these criteria. They may certify you as homebound

                              to leave the house, or if leaving home could
                              exacerbate your illness. Additionally, leaving
                              home requires considerable effort, and when you
                              do, it's typically for essential activities such

                          patients, includes the cost of home health aides when

                          services from a Medicare-certified provider, as

                          cover the cost of a home health aide if it is the sole
                          need, and patients also benefit from the support of
                          other professionals within the home health team, such
                          as nurses, physical therapists, occupational
                          therapists, speech therapists, and medical social

                          If you qualify for home health care and your physician
                          prescribes the assistance of an in-home health aide,
                          you may be eligible for Medicare coverage for home
                          health aides, with potential coverage also offered by
                          Medicaid and major insurance plans for those meeting
                          eligibility criteria. Agencies such as DC Medical
                          System can provide guidance on Medicare coverage for
                          home health aides, including any associated
                          out-of-pocket expenses, before initiating care. It's
                          important to note that Medicare typically covers home
                          health aide services when coupled with nursing care or
                          therapy within the home health care plan, but does not
                          cover home health aides as a standalone service.
