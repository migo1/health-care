                    Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) refers to the use of
                    technology to monitor and track patients' health data
                    outside of traditional healthcare settings, such as in the
                    comfort of their homes. This technology allows healthcare
                    professionals to collect a patient's vital signs, symptoms,
                    and other health data in real time, typically through
                    devices like wearable sensors, mobile apps, or other
                    monitoring tools.

                        In-home health remote patient monitoring employs
                        wearable devices and sensors to gather patient data.
                        This data is securely transmitted to our healthcare
                        providers through protected communication channels.
                        These devices gauge vital signs, enabling doctors to
                        oversee the health conditions of patients remotely.

                        Remote patient monitoring applies to a diverse group of
                        individuals, particularly those dealing with chronic or
                        complex health conditions needing consistent monitoring
                        and care. RPM proves beneficial for patients with
                        ailments such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease,
                        chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or those
                        in post-surgical recovery. Moreover, individuals
                        recently discharged from the hospital in need of close
                        monitoring and those residing in remote areas with
                        restricted healthcare access are also eligible for RPM.
